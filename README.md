This program will help you to go through the JSON file. Firstly, you have to choose the JSON file (with your friends or followers). Then, enter the number of people and after choose one person from a list. After you will see the list with available parameters, feel free to choose as many as you need, but be aware that you can choose each parameter only one time. If the parameter that you choose contains other parameters you have to continue choosing until you come to the end. 
If you finish choosing than write 'finished' or 'stop' or 'I like Rayn Gosling' and all the parameters that you chose will be shown.
